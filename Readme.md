# Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline with AWS EC2

This project demonstrates a Jenkins-based CI/CD pipeline that:
- Pulls code from GitHub
- Builds the application using Maven
- Runs unit tests
- Deploys the application to an AWS EC2 instance

## Tools Used
- Jenkins
- GitHub
- Maven
- AWS EC2
- Java

## How It Works
Every time code is pushed to GitHub, Jenkins automatically triggers the pipeline and deploys the application to EC2.
